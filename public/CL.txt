Hi techcarrot Team, I am a Gouder from Algeria , I am 18 yo and i've been learning frontend development since senior high school year, from then i made multiple websites and here is my portfolio "https://gouder-pf.vercel.app" if you want to see some of my projects, since I found myself making a progress at it I wanted to implement those skills on real world problems with real teams like the team that is based in techcarrot, i hope i find the opportunity to work with you and progress in my career, Thank You
